# Eating Disorders Prediction

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the project on predicting symptoms and recovery from eating disorders. 

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included in the `data` directory. It consists of anonymized participant data collected through questionnaires related to eating disorder symptoms, self-perception, self-acceptance, and quality of life. The data has been preprocessed and scaled to ensure compatibility with the machine learning models.

## Code

The main code files for this project are the `Predecir EAT.ipynb` and `Predecir Nivel de recuperaci√≥n.ipynb` Jupyter Notebooks. They contain all the necessary code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result analysis. 

## Results

The `results` directory contains the output and analysis of the predictive models. This includes evaluation metrics, such as F1-score, ROC AUC, specificity, sensitivity, and R2 score.
